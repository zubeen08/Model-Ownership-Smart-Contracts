Project Title:
Model Ownership Smart Contracts

Project Description:
The Model Ownership Smart Contract is a decentralized application (dApp) built using Ethereum's Solidity programming language, designed to track and manage the ownership of models. These models could be anything from machine learning models, intellectual property (IP), digital artwork, or even patents. The smart contract allows the transfer of ownership between parties, ensuring that the ownership is transparently managed and immutable on the blockchain.

Project Vision:
The vision of this project is to provide a way to track the ownership of intellectual property, models, or any creative digital work on the blockchain. This would enable creators, developers, and businesses to securely assign, transfer, and prove ownership of their work without the need for intermediaries. The smart contract ensures that ownership changes are transparent, traceable, and immutable.

Key Features:
Ownership Transfer: Only the current owner can transfer the ownership to a new address.

Ownership Tracking: The contract keeps track of the current owner's address, model name, and description.

Security: Transfers can only be performed by the current owner, preventing unauthorized changes.

Transparency: Ownership details are publicly available on the blockchain, and any transfer of ownership is logged via events.

Future Scope:
Royalty Payments: The smart contract could be extended to allow for royalty payments whenever the model is used or sold.

Fractional Ownership: Future versions could include features for fractional ownership, allowing multiple parties to own parts of the model.

Decentralized Marketplace Integration: The contract could be integrated with a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling model ownership.

Access Control: Additional functionality could allow the owner to grant permissions for others to use or modify the model.
